/**
 * File: rdma_ops.h
 * Purpose: Prototypes for posting RDMA operations and CQ polling.
 *
 * Overview:
 * Wraps verbs calls to post WRITE/READ/SEND/RECV and a CQ polling helper that prints WC fields. Keeps data-path logic tidy in main programs.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - This file is part of an educational RDMA sample showing connection setup,
 *    memory registration, and basic one-sided operations (WRITE/READ) and
 *    WRITE_WITH_IMM (two-sided notification). Comments are intentionally verbose.
 *  - The code targets librdmacm + libibverbs (RoCEv2/SoftRoCE friendly).
